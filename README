My name is Haley Tarala and this is my HW1 raytracing project.

To compile the raytracer, the command is:
g++ raytracer.cpp -LGL -lGLEW -lglfw

The project relies on the linear algebra library Eigen, which can be found at https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

When compiled, just type ./a.out <viewpoint>

The available viewpoints are:
default
back
right
left
top
bottom
corner

If no viewpoint is chosen, the program will use the default viewpoint. Once the window opens,
the arrow keys can be used to turn the camera and WASD can be used to move your viewpoint around.
